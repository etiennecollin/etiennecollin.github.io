This project started with the idea to introduce neural networks, artificial intelligence, to students. For those who are not familiar with artificial intelligence, the concept may be intimidating; how can my computer learn how to do certain tasks by itself and help me do them? The goal of this project is to make this technology accessible and show how it may be used to optimize and speedup processes, lose less time doing repetitive tasks and validate manually found data.

By following this tutorial, you will learn how to program an image detection neural network that detects different objects and counts them. Of course, with little tweaks, one could do many other things with the model. Feel free to fork the project and share your own neural network.
