Hey! My name is Etienne. I'm a computer science student and Schulich Leader at Université de Montréal fascinated by
artificial intelligence, but I'm also a photographer! I have been involved with many clients throughout the years and I
am still open for business.

Whether you are interested in my [computer science projects](https://etiennecollin.com/cs), my
[photography projects](https://etiennecollin.com/photography) or my
[other projects](https://etiennecollin.com/projects), do not hesitate to contact me! I am open to collaborating on
projects with others and it will be my pleasure, if that's the case, to help you make your vision a reality in terms of
photography.
